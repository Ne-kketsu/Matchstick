# Matchstick
My very first project with an Artificial Intelligence (Mostly random and unimpressive...but it gets the job done!). //
//USAGE//
1. in root directory (Matchstick), open terminal and enter "make" command.
2. Execute matchstick file by entering "./matchstick [nb_lines] [max_nb_matches_to_remove]"
